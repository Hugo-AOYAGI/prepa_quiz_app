# QMIN

This repo is the front end code of a Quiz application I build on flutter in order to assist me in my studies. Questions are split in subjects and categories for a better learning experience.

## Download

First you will need to install [flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
NB: Updating your environment variables is not necessary.
You'll then need to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). 
Please follow the tutorial on the flutter install, you will need to enable sdk tools on android studio and all of it is explained.

Once this is done, download this repository and unzip it. Then you just have to open the flutter console located in the flutter folder.

You then need to navigate to the folder of the repository with ```cd Path/To/Folder``` execute the command ```flutter run --release``` in your command prompt.
