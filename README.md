# QMIN

This repo is the front end code of a Quiz application I build on flutter in order to assist me in my studies. Questions are split in subjects and categories for a better learning experience.

## Download (Android - Only)

Download the app-release.apk from the apk folder. Place the apk in any folder on your phone. Open file manager on the phone and run the apk.
Android will prompt you to send reports or not download this app. Unless you really trust me, you shouldn't run the apk and go against the recommendations.
If you know anything about flutter you can read the source code to check there isn't anything malicious in this app.
